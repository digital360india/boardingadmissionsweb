      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Services Provided:</strong> Boarding Admissions offers guidance,
        preparation, and coaching for students seeking admission to top boarding
        schools across India. This includes mock exams, interview preparation,
        aptitude tests, and study materials. We do not guarantee admission to
        any specific school, as the final decision rests with the schools
        themselves.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Enrollment in Preparation Programs:</strong> Parents or
        guardians must enroll their child in one of our preparation programs
        through the official Boarding Admissions website or office. All required
        forms and documents must be completed accurately. Enrollment is
        confirmed once full payment for the selected program is received.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Preparation Content:</strong> Our preparation programs are
        tailored to meet the admission requirements of India&apos;s top boarding
        schools. This includes academic content, mock exams, and interview
        training. We aim to prepare students as thoroughly as possible, but
        performance in actual entrance exams is the student&apos;s responsibility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Entrance Exam Dates and Information:</strong> While we help with
        preparation, parents, and guardians are responsible for registering
        their children for the official entrance exams and interviews with the
        boarding schools they are applying to. Boarding Admissions will provide
        general guidance but does not handle exam registrations for individual
        schools.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Payment Terms:</strong> Full payment is required to enroll in
        our preparation programs. Payments are non-refundable unless explicitly
        stated in our refund policy. We offer various packages, and fees are
        detailed on our website. Payment plans may be available upon request and
        must be agreed upon before enrollment.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Refund and Cancellation Policy:</strong> Refunds are only
        provided if a cancellation request is submitted within 7 days of
        enrollment and before any preparation materials have been accessed.
        Refunds are unavailable if preparation has already begun or materials
        have been distributed. Exceptions may apply in special circumstances at
        the discretion of Boarding Admissions.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Attendance and Participation:</strong> Students are expected to
        attend all scheduled sessions, including online classes, mock tests, and
        interviews. Active participation is crucial for the success of the
        preparation program. Missed sessions will not be rescheduled unless
        there are exceptional circumstances, which should be communicated in
        advance.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Preparation Results:</strong> While Boarding Admissions offers
        high-quality preparation services, we do not guarantee specific results.
        Admission to boarding schools is based on multiple factors, including
        but not limited to student performance, school requirements, and
        competition from other applicants. The ultimate responsibility for
        passing the entrance exams lies with the student.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Communication with Boarding Schools:</strong> Boarding
        Admissions provides general guidance on the boarding school application
        process but does not communicate directly with boarding schools on
        behalf of students. Parents or guardians are responsible for submitting
        applications and following up with individual schools.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Confidentiality and Privacy:</strong> All personal information
        shared with Boarding Admissions is treated with strict confidentiality.
        We do not share student or parent details with third parties without
        explicit consent, except where required by law.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Students enrolled in Boarding
        Admissions programs are expected to behave in a respectful and
        disciplined manner. Disruptive behavior may result in expulsion from the
        program without a refund. Parents or guardians are encouraged to ensure
        students remain committed and focused during preparation.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Changes to Programs:</strong> Boarding Admissions reserves the
        right to modify, alter, or discontinue any of its preparation programs,
        content, or schedules. In the event of significant changes, enrolled
        students and their parents will be notified promptly.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg mb-4">
        <strong>Limitation of Liability:</strong> Boarding Admissions prepares
        students to excel, but we do not guarantee admission success. While we
        provide the best possible preparation, meeting the specific criteria for
        boarding schools is ultimately the student&apos;s responsibility.
